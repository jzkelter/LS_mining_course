So far we have been defining a context simply as the entire document in which the word appears. But there are many other ways we could define a context. The task here is to try some other contexts. One possibility is to look at the collection of utterances in which the word appears. In that case, we'd be treating each utterance as a document when we make are termxdocument matrix. To facilitate this a bit, I made a function that loads the corpus for you, but gives each transcript as a list of tokenized utterances. It's invoked in the next cell."
